Placed side by side with participant work.

### flon

1. From Latin _flumen_ (river).
2. The name of the project.

### participant

TODO

### participant work

The work done by a flon worker to hand workitems forth and back to participants. Also comprises the work involved when handing cancellation workitems to participants.

Participant work can be thought as part of the execution work, but since it deals on the boundary of the execution, with participants, it is practical to label it separately.

### workflon

Contraction of _workflow_ and _flon_. Not yet used.

### workflow

Could be thought of as _routine_, _recipe_, _program_, _script_, _scenario_, ... Has indeed many definitions.

In the flon context, a workflow is a program conducted by a flon (understood as a web of flon workers) from start to end.

A workflow generally has a goal, be it transformation and/or circulation of data by/to participants.
